## Installation

You can install this Go module with `go install`:

```sh
go install github.com/jcbhmr/go-mdbook/cmd/mdbook@latest
```

This will install a Go wrapper binary that embeds the official mdBook released binaries from the [rust-lang/mdBook GitHub releases](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases).

Now you can use the installed `mdbook` binary as described by the [mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
